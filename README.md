# Image Recognition App with Tensorflow JS and React JS

We are going to use the pre-trained machine learning model from Tensorflow JS called mobilenet. This model is specifically used for image classification. This is a very simple app that uses tensorflow model, and tries to identify the content of the image.

So if we use an image of animals like cats, dogs or other simple things, The Tensorflow will work behind the scenes to identify the content for this image, and will display the results in 3 guesses.
